# auto-highlight-symbol-hydra
The Spacemacs Auto-Highlight Symbol Hydra, ported over to vanilla Emacs

## TODO

### `r` keeps resetting from "Buffer"

* try `ahs-default-range'
* since temporarily switching triggers some crazy latency

### it's not case-sensitive

hmmmm

### simultaneously display `overlay-count' for all three ranges

no idea how to do this

### display legend for what the key colors mean

easy

### Fix _d_, _D_, and _R_
